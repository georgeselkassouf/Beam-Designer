# Beam Designer Tool
This is a small tool I developed using Python.


# Description

This tool can be used for the design and analysis of singly reinforced concrete beams in the imperial and metric system as per ACI 318-19.

At this moment, it only supports rectangular sections and is limited to flexural design/analysis.

The graphical user interface was developed using the Tkinter library.

You can see below a small representation of the GUI.


# Launch as Executable in Windows
Download the beamdesigner.exe file inside the **.exe** directory and install it.
